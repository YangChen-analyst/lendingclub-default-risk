#  Loan Default Risk Analysis — End-to-End BI, Data Analytics & Data Science Project

This project demonstrates a full pipeline — from data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical testing to predictive modeling and an interactive BI dashboard — to identify and mitigate high-risk borrower segments in Lending Club’s loan portfolio.

---

##  **Business Objective**

**Key Question:** *Which borrower segments pose higher loan default risk, and how can Lending Club adjust lending policies to reduce losses?*

By combining data analytics, machine learning, and BI visualization, this project enables stakeholders to:
- Pinpoint borrower characteristics linked to higher defaults.
- Visualize risk concentration by geography, credit grade, income, and purpose.
- Deploy predictive models to flag high-risk loans proactively.

##  **Project Workflow**

| Phase | Deliverable | Tools |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| **1 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** | Remove duplicates, handle nulls, engineer `Default Flag` | Python (Pandas) |
| **2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** | Correlation heatmaps, T-tests, pattern discovery | Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib) |
| **3 Predictive Modeling** | Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SHAP | scikit-learn, SHAP |
| **4 Business Intelligence Dashboard** | Interactive Tableau dashboard for business users | Tableau |
| **5 Executive Presentation** | 10-slide deck summarizing risk insights & recommendations | PowerPoint |

##  **Dataset Overview**

- **Source:** [Kaggle Lending Club Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielsantello/lending-club-loan-preprocessed-dataset)
- **Rows:** ~1M historical loan records
- **Features:** ~30 variables (income, employment, credit grade, purpose)
- **Target:** `loan_status` → Fully Paid or Charged Off
- **Key Feature Engineering:** Derived binary `Default Flag`; state-level aggregation

---


##  **Key Results**

- **Best Performing Model:** XGBoost (ROC AUC: 0.72)
- **Most Influential Features:** `sub_grade`, `annual_inc`, `int_rate`, `open_acc`, `loan_amnt`
- **SHAP Explainability:** Higher `sub_grade` and `int_rate`, and lower `annual_inc` significantly drive default predictions.
- **Business Implication:** These features guide Lending Club’s risk-based loan pricing and approval strategies.


---

##  **Dashboard Highlights**

The Tableau dashboard provides:
- KPI summary (default rate, loan amount, income)
- Risk by **income**, **grade**, **purpose**, **term**, **home ownership**
- Regional map of default risk across U.S. states

 *The dashboard helps stakeholders quickly spot emerging grid instability and adjust policies accordingly.*

---

##  **Actionable Recommendations**

1. Tighten approval criteria for **Grades E–G** and incomes below **$50k**.
2. Offer shorter loan terms to reduce default exposure.
3. Adjust interest rates for risk-based pricing.
4. Monitor states with growing default clusters.
5. Integrate predictive model scores into loan origination systems.
